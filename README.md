## For those who remember the original Codingyard

I originally wrote the site using [Dropwizard](http://www.dropwizard.io/) + AngularJS and I thought I was awesome enough to accomplish tasks common to web development by pulling different libraries and using them myself. Well, I was able to do some, but then development cycle became quite slow and I got tired, frustrated, and eventually quit working on it... :(

I learned my lesson, and re-wrote the website in Ruby on Rails. Here is the [original source code](https://github.com/TurtleShip/codingyard-deprecated) I wrote using Dropwizard.
