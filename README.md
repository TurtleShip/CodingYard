# Overview
This is source code for [CodingYard website](www.codingyard.com) .. sort of.
Long story short, I originally wrote the site using [Dropwizard](http://www.dropwizard.io/) and I thought I was awesome enough to accomplish tasks common to web development by pulling different libraries and using them myself. Well, I was able to do some, but then development cycle became quite slow and I got tired, frustrated, and eventually quit working on it... :(

Now I learned my lesson, and am starting fresh by re-writing the website in Ruby on Rails. Here is the [original source code](https://github.com/TurtleShip/codingyard-deprecated) I wrote using Dropwizard.

I started working on re-writing the website on Oct 29th, 2015, and plan to finish by Nov. 30th, 2015.
